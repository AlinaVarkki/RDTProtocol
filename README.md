# CS313 Networking Group Assessment | Reliable Data Transfer (RDT) 

This project contains java implementation of pipelined Reliable Data Transfer transfer layer protocol. RDT handles lost and corrupted packets by implementing a queue that keeps track of send packets and a checksum. The code includes a network simulator that makes use of the protocol.

# Output
When the simulation is run, packets behaviour is displayed
